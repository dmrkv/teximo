      ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT - Security Warning Fix:
      
      When you first try to launch Teximo, macOS will show a security warning:
      > "Teximo" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.
      
      To fix this, you MUST:
      - Right-click on Teximo.app in Applications folder
      - Select "Open" from the context menu
      - Click "Open" in the security dialog
      
      This is a one-time step - after this, Teximo will launch normally!
      
      Teximo has been installed to:
        #{prefix}/Teximo.app
      
      You can also run it from the command line:
        teximo
    EOS
  end

  test do
    # Test that the app can be launched
    system "#{bin}/teximo", "--version"
  end
end
