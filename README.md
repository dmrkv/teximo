A beautiful macOS menu bar app for keyboard layout switching and text manipulation.

- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects text direction for transliteration
- **Beautiful UI**: Clean, modern interface with guided setup

## Installation

### Option 1: Homebrew (Recommended)
```bash
brew install dmrkv/teximo/teximo
```

> **Note**: This installs Teximo from the Homebrew tap. Make sure you have Homebrew installed first.

### Option 2: Download from Releases
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/dmrkv/teximo/releases) page
2. Download the latest `Teximo.dmg` file
3. Open the DMG and drag Teximo to your Applications folder
4. **ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT - Security Warning Fix:**
   
   When you first try to launch Teximo, macOS will show a security warning:
   > "Teximo" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.
   
   **To fix this, you MUST:**
   - **Right-click** on Teximo.app in Applications folder
   - Select **"Open"** from the context menu
   - Click **"Open"** in the security dialog
   
   This is a one-time step - after this, Teximo will launch normally!
5. Launch Teximo from Applications

### Option 3: Build from Source
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `Teximo.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run (Cmd+R)

## First Launch

When you first launch Teximo, you'll see a beautiful permission window guiding you through enabling accessibility permissions:

2. Navigate to Privacy & Security â†’ Accessibility
3. Click the lock icon and enter your password
4. Find 'Teximo' in the list and check the box
5. Return to Teximo and click "Check Again"

## Usage
