# Teximo

A seamless macOS menu bar app for keyboard layout switching and text manipulation.

## Features

- **âŒ˜+Shift**: Switch keyboard layouts instantly
- **Ctrl+Shift**: Transliterate text between English and Russian (Cyrillic)
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects text direction for transliteration
- **Invisible Operation**: Works seamlessly in the background without interrupting your workflow

## Installation

### Option 1: Homebrew (Recommended)
```bash
brew install dmrkv/teximo/teximo
```

> **Note**: This installs Teximo from the Homebrew tap. Make sure you have Homebrew installed first.

### Option 2: Download from Releases
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/dmrkv/teximo/releases) page
2. Download the latest `Teximo.dmg` file
3. Open the DMG and drag Teximo to your Applications folder
4. **ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT - Security Warning Fix:**
   
   When you first try to launch Teximo, macOS will show a security warning:
   > "Teximo.app Not Opened"

   **To fix this, you MUST:**
   - Go to MacOS Settings (Spotlight â†’ System Settings)
   - Click **"Open"** in the security dialog
   - In the left sidebar find "Privacy and Security", and then in the right side of the window find "Security" â†’ "Teximo.app" was blocked to protect your Mac. Click on "Open anyway"

   - When you run Teximo next time from Applications, click again on "Open anyway"
     <img width="372" height="440" alt="Screenshot 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d9de770-a6fd-4a98-a174-9f48d4887a10" />

   This is a one-time step - after this, Teximo will launch normally!
6. After that launch Teximo from Applications

### Option 3: Build from Source
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `Teximo.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run (Cmd+R)

## First Launch

When you first launch Teximo, you'll see a permission window guiding you through enabling accessibility permissions:

1. Click "Open System Settings"
2. Navigate to Privacy & Security â†’ Accessibility
4. Find 'Teximo' in the list and check the box

## Usage

Once permissions are granted, Teximo will appear in your menu bar with a "T" icon. The app works globally in any application:

- **âŒ˜+Shift**: Switch between keyboard layouts
- **Ctrl+Shift**: Select text and press this combination to transliterate between English and Russian

## Troubleshooting

### Security Warning Issues
If you see "Teximo cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified":
1. **Right-click** on Teximo.app in Applications folder
2. Select **"Open"** from the context menu
3. Click **"Open"** in the security dialog

### Alternative Method (if right-click doesn't work):
1. Go to **System Preferences** â†’ **Security & Privacy** â†’ **General**
2. Look for a message about Teximo being blocked
3. Click **"Open Anyway"**
